# Hindenberry AirFrame

This project describes the design of a frame.  The frame is ment to
used together with helium balloons, a motor controller and a 
Raspberry Pi to build an autonomous airship.

## Printing the frame

The DWG files describe the design of the frame.  They were made using
DraftSight.  The SVG files are derived from the DWG files.  They can
be used to cut the frame out of a 3mm thick 300x600 mm wooden board 
using a laser cutter.  The red lines will be cut, blue lines will be
partially cut and gray or black is engraved.
